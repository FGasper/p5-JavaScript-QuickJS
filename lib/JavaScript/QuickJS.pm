=head1 NAME

JavaScript::QuickJS - Run JavaScript via L<QuickJS|https://bellard.org/quickjs> in Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick and dirty …

    my $val = JavaScript::QuickJS->new()->eval( q<
        console.log("Hello, Perl!");
        [ "The", "last", "value", "is", "returned." ];
    > );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This library embeds Fabrice Bellard’s L<QuickJS|https://bellard.org/quickjs>
engine into Perl. You can thus run JavaScript directly in your Perl programs.

No external C libraries are needed; we embed QuickJS directly into the
generated XS module.

=head1 METHODS

For now only a static interface is provided:

=head2 $obj = I<CLASS>->new()

Instantiates I<CLASS>.

=head2 $obj = I<OBJ>->set_globals( NAME1 => VALUE1, .. )

Sets 1 or more globals in I<OBJ>. See below for details on type conversions
from Perl to JavaScript.

=head2 $obj = I<OBJ>->helpers()

Defines QuickJS’s “helpers”, e.g., C<console.log>.

=head2 $obj = I<OBJ>->std()

Enables (but does I<not> import) QuickJS’s C<std> module.

=head2 $obj = I<OBJ>->os()

Like C<std()> but for QuickJS’s C<os> module.

=head2 $VALUE = eval( $JS_CODE )

Comparable to running C<qjs -e '...'>. Returns the last value from $JS_CODE;
see below for details on type conversions from JavaScript to Perl.

Untrapped exceptions in JavaScript will be rethrown as Perl exceptions.

=head2 eval_module( $JS_CODE )

Runs $JS_CODE as a module, which enables ES6 module syntax.
Note that no values can be returned directly in this mode of execution.

=head1 TYPE CONVERSION: JAVASCRIPT → PERL

This module converts returned values from JavaScript thus:

=over

=item * JS string primitives become I<character> strings in Perl.

=item * JS number & boolean primitives become corresponding Perl values.

=item * JS null & undefined become Perl undef.

=item * JS objects …

=over

=item * Arrays become Perl array references.

=item * “Plain” objects become Perl hash references.

=item * Functions become Perl code references.

=item * Behaviour is B<UNDEFINED> for other object types.

=back

=head1 TYPE CONVERSION: PERL → JAVASCRIPT

Generally speaking, it’s the inverse of JS → Perl, though since Perl doesn’t
differentiate “numeric strings” from “numbers” there’s occasional ambiguity.
In such cases, behavior is undefined; be sure to typecast in JavaScript
accordingly.

=over

=item * Perl strings, numbers, & booleans become corresponding JavaScript
primitives.

=item * Perl undef becomes JS null.

=item * Unblessed array & hash references become JavaScript arrays and
“plain” objects.

=item * Perl code references become JavaScript functions.

=item * Anything else triggers an exception.

=back

=head1 PLATFORM NOTES

Due to QuickJS limitations, Linux & macOS are the only platforms known
to work “out-of-the-box”. Other POSIX OSes I<should> work with some small
tweaks to quickjs; see the compiler errors and F<quickjs.c> for more
details.

Pull requests to improve portability are welcome!

=head1 SEE ALSO

Other JavaScript modules on CPAN include:

=over

=item * L<JavaScript::Duktape::XS> and L<JavaScript::Duktape> make the
L<Duktape|https://duktape.org> library available to Perl. They’re similar to
this library, but Duktape itself (as of this writing) lacks support for
several JavaScript constructs that QuickJS supports. (It’s also slower.)

=item * L<JavaScript::V8> and L<JavaScript::V8::XS> expose Google’s
L<V8|https://v8.dev> library to Perl. Neither seems to support current
V8 versions.

=item * L<JE> is a pure-Perl (!) JavaScript engine.

=item * L<JavaScript> and L<JavaScript::Lite> expose Mozilla’s
L<SpiderMonkey|https://spidermonkey.dev/> engine to Perl.
