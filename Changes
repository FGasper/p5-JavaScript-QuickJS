- QuickJS runtime info is now set to the module name. (Debugging aid.)
- Docs improvement for memory-leak notifications. (Thank you, perlancar!)

0.12 Mon 6 Jan 2022
- Add await() so Perl can wait until JS’s pending jobs finish.
- Make eval_module() return the JS object so chaining is easier.
- Explicitly document interfaces that return the JS object.

0.11 Sun 15 May 2022
- BREAKING CHANGE: JavaScript Functions converted to Perl now become
  instances of a new class, JavaScript::QuickJS::Function. That class
  is overloaded to act as a coderef, so MOST calling code should still
  work, but anything that expects a CODE reference will now instead find
  a blessed object.
- BUG FIX: Fix leaked scalars returned from Perl callbacks.
- Tweak discussion of memory-leak detection.
- Add missing regexp test.
